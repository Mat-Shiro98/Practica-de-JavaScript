Hi Stefan

My name´s Matt. I´m 25, and I´m from Buenos aires, in Argentina.
I´m a Web designer at a Software Engineering. I´m studing English becuse I need it for outside the country.

I live with my parents, my brother and sister. My father works in the office and my mother is an event designer.
My brother works in a deposit with pioneer and my sister are at school.

In my free time I play the videogames, play the guitar and go to the coffee shop.
In the evening I like play with friends or listening to music or read books. I really like rock music but I hate reggeton.

Please write soon.

Best wishes
Matt
